* (Note) `DDlog` is just a Datalog flavored language frontend. It differs from "vanilla" Datalog as it is [statically typed](https://github.com/vmware-archive/differential-datalog/blob/master/doc/tutorial/tutorial.md#hello-world-in-ddlog), it compiles to [Differential Dataflow](https://github.com/vmware-archive/differential-datalog/blob/master/doc/tutorial/tutorial.md#relation-transformers), is [turing complete](https://github.com/vmware-archive/differential-datalog/issues/824) and it supports [negation](https://github.com/vmware-archive/differential-datalog/blob/master/doc/tutorial/tutorial.md#negations-and-antijoins).

* (Paper) `Differential Dataflow`  introduction completed.
